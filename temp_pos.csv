Kept hearing rather loud sounds throughout the the night and it never seemed to let up.  If you are a light sleeper I would find somewhere else, which sucks because other than that the place is great."

Appreciated flexibility with earlier check in and later check out. <br/>Not happy about the smell in the apartment. It smells really bad - like very old cigarette smoke. The drain in the shower were flooded after a short shower. The apartment is located on a street with lots of bars so it’s very loud during the night."

753,"Staff were amazing. All amenities amazing. However, the tents are made of a brown material that absorbs and radiates heat. In the summer if it’s 21 degrees outside, then it’s 25-28 degrees inside. Unbearable to sleep in and actually impossible for me over my five days stay, hence why the low rating. <br/>If you can sleep in a hellscape and don’t mind sweating and replenishing fluids constantly all night then sure, amazing place great value and comfortable beds. Otherwise, just get a hotel room or airbnb with air conditioning. Not worth the money saved to burn alive each night"

1968,The apartment was spacious and good for our large group. the host company was difficult to communicate with. the airbnb was sparse and had very little in at far as kitchen supplies go. we stay in airbnbs so we can cook and there was definitely a lack of cooking ware. Also the wifi was just a mess.
2448,"Gustav let us check in early on short notice, and the location is great. <br/>There was disruptive construction at the building entrance which made access to the building difficult on certain days (we had to walk through the construction site every day, sometimes while heavy machinery was actively in use). The host did not inform us about the construction. <br/>The bedroom was infested with moths. (We killed about 15 during our stay. They were always around.) <br/>The bathroom is very small, and you shower directly on the floor so that when using the toilet anytime after showering, your feet get wet. <br/>The apartment was cold (the building's central heating wasn't running while we were there), so it would have been nice to have had some extra blankets for the bed and to use in the living room. The bed has two single-size light blankets. <br/>The living room is very nice and spacious, and the couch is comfortable. All of the blinds in the apartment do a good job of blocking light."

2315,The location is perfect right near the metro and just an easy walk to restaurants and attractions. It has a fully equipped kitchen and a washer and dryer which was great! Emilie was responsive and helpful. We did really struggle with the bathroom though which was impractical and had very low pressure to the shower. The bed was very uncomfortable hard and sunk in the middle so we rolled into each other. The apartment was also not that clean and had a very strong and unpleasant smell. Also note there is 5 flights of stairs with no lift.
