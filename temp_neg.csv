36,Poor location and neighbourhood. Took lots of effort to find the Airbnb.
99,"Unfortunately very disappointing listing. The bed is a 120x190cm, which a large single bed, not a double bed. The host defended themselves saying others didn’t mind but :<br/>1/ others have said it in the comments which I discarded initially as them being « picky ». They were right. <br/>2/ A person travelling with a kid, or two very young adults (ok with sleeping on top of one another) would be ok. <br/>Sleeping is an important part of the experience so for me, having one of us sleep on the floor (which we had to) overshadows the fact that the place is nicely decorated or well located. The host should just change their bed for a two people one and acknowledge the inaccuracy of their listing when a guest points it out. To add for clarity to previous comments, yes, it’s quite noisy and on the ground floor (bedroom is street-side and one wall is shared with the building entrance)."
216,"Located a 5 minute walk away to the Norreport metro, which is great. However, if you’re a light sleeper, I’d be weary of staying here. The bedroom walls are very thin so you can hear ALL conversation. While Carsten was nice, him and his daughter are a bit loud in the mornings. The floors are also very loud and creaky. Lastly, the home smelt of smoke, which I wish I had been warned of because I have asthma. I had to hold my breath walking to my room because it smelt so strongly. I had a headache each time after entering. I also wish the room had a way to lock for security when leaving items at the Airbnb while exploring the city. If these things don’t bother you, then you’re fine to book. It was in a central, safe area"
542,"This was a disappointing stay. The communication wasn’t great, we had to wait for the neighbor to come let us in because our host wasn’t there. The check in and check out time is a very short window from 4pm to 8am. The check out instructions almost cost us two missed flights. It should be made very clear that you need to have the keys to get out of the gate, when all the instructions say is to leave the keys on the counter.  Most gates open up automatically when trying to leave so we had to wait an hour until we were finally able to flag someone down to help us get out. There was hair on the bed along with a used drinking glass next to the bed. The fridge was full so we were unable to put anything in it. The location was fine but not the most desired area."
597,"In general the apartment is ok, but the details that make a comfortable stay are missing. <br/>First of all the bedroom was different. In the photo it was a spacious room with two windows. but in fact it was a smal dark room with one window. It also indicates the accomodation of three people but in fact sleeping place for third person is just a sofa   on which it is simply not to possible to sleep.  Also they haven't cleaned under this sofa for ages.<br/>There are coffee machine and electric kettle, but there are no coffee or tea. None of the basic products: salt for example. The kettle was so dirty, not cleaned from limescale we couldn't use it. There were also no dishwashing detergents and the dishwasher stank terribly. <br/>Excellent location in the center, but this is also a disadvantage. It's not possible to sleep, the courtyard connected to the cafe: Workers are constantly smoking there, unloading something very loud. Our expectations  were not met"
713,Not very good
781,"Very dirty house with moldy damp bathrooms, multiple unflushed toilets, and cardboard stiff linens and towels with numerous stains. One “shower” is a hose connected to the faucet in the tub. Extremely slow drains. We did not complete our stay here given how uncomfortable the whole place was."
905,"Airbnb stay in Copenhagen July 22-26 was a bit of a disappointment. <br/>It is a nice appartment but it<br/> seems like things were quickly thrown together for our stay. Though the property listed towels as an amenity, there were no towels in the sight. We text the host the following morning and we got a reply several hours later. In the end, we had to pop-out to the shop and brought our own towels.<br/>The space was lacking in cleanliness, and with the host's personal things lying about it gives one the feeling that he just ran out to do errands and will be right back, not relaxing."
926,We did not expect to have a shower in the room... it was a bit uncomfortable as it provoked a lack of privacy among guests.
1190,"It was a relatively nice place to stay for an extended period. The only issue was that the pictures didn't match the actual suite. There were several large, unsightly pipes on the ceiling of my suite. Overall, the cost is a bit higher considering what you actually receive from this place."
